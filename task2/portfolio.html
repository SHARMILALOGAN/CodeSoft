      <p> As a 3rd-year AI & Data Science student, I'm passionate about using ML, SQL, NoSQL, and web development to transform data into actionable insights. I love using machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns, and I'm fascinated by how SQL and NoSQL databases organize and retrieve data efficiently. To bring these insights to life, I'm now venturing into web development, eager to build user-friendly applications powered by machine learning. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow, whether through online courses, personal projects. </p>

        <h3>Multiple Disease Prediction Using ML and Streamlit</h3>
        <img src="C:\Users\ELCOT\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (1750).png" alt="Multiple Disease Prediction ">
        <p>This project combines machine learning with a user-friendly web app. By leveraging datasets from Kaggle, you can train a model to predict the risk of multiple diseases based on user input. Streamlit allows you to build this web app, where users can enter their information and receive risk predictions for various diseases, potentially promoting early detection and better healthcare outcomes.</p>

        <h3>Movie Recommendation System</h3>
        <img src="C:\Users\ELCOT\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot (1749).png" alt="Movie Recommendation System">
        <p>This project tackles movie recommendations with a user-friendly twist! We'll leverage movie data from sources like Kaggle and train a machine learning model to suggest films based on your preferences. Built with Streamlit, the web app allows you to search or browse movies, even rate them for a more personalized experience. The model, using either content or user similarities, then recommends movies you'll likely enjoy, helping you navigate the vast world of cinema and discover hidden gems.</p>
